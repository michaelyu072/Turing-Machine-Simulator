# Turing-Machine-Simulator
Hello! This is a Turing Machine simulator/visualizer in C++.

It contains two Turing Machines:
1. TM that accepts string of 0n 1n (number of zeroes followed by same number of ones)
2. TM that reverses an input string over alphabet {A,B}

to run the program, clone the repo and run ```./a.out``` to run the executable. Alternatively you can compile the C++ code on your own.

Example of Program Execution:
